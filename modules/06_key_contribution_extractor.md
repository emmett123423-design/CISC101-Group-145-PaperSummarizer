Steps
Locate contribution statements:
Common loci: Abstract, Introduction, Contributions/Overview, Conclusion/Discussion sections.
Phrase detection: “We contribute…”, “Our main contributions…”, “This work presents…”.
Extract and normalize:
Concise explanation: a single sentence restating the contribution exactly as claimed.
Three bullets: each grounded in text, with bold lead-ins, capturing scope, novelty, and impact.
Validation:
Traceability: each bullet must quote or paraphrase explicit claims.
No merging: do not fuse multiple contributions unless the text does so.
Outputs
Key Contributions: list of contributions with one-sentence explanation and three bullets per contribution.
